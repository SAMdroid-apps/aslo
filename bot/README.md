# Mining Activities

Do you have some spare compute power?
Why not help ASLO by mining activities!

First make sure you have:

* Git
* Requests (Py2): `yum install python-requests`
* PoLib (Py2): `pip install polib`
* CairoSVG: `pip install cairosvg`
* Sugar - not running, but just so the setup.py files can work

Then just run `python2 main.py` and off you mine!

If you have any issues please contact me.
