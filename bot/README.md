# Mining Activities

Do you have some spare compute power?
Why not help ASLO by mining activities!

First make sure you have:

* Git
* Requests (Py2): `yum install python-requests`
* PoLib (Py2): `pip install polib`
* CairoSVG: `pip install cairosvg`

Then just run `python2 main.py` and off you mine!

> **Note**: you will automatically be booted of the network when the master restarts.
> That is a good time to `git pull` and restart your bot.

If you have any issues please contact me.
