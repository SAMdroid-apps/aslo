A portfolio feature lets you use Turtle Blocks for making presentations. <br/> Turtle Blocks is intended to be a stepping stone to Logo, but there are many restrictions compared to Logo. Turtle Blocks was written by Brian Silverman and is maintained by Walter Bender and Raul Gutierrez. Arjun Sarwal added the sensor features. Tony Forster is the most inspired user."
