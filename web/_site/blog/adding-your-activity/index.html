<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The new ASLO provides users with a new way to discover and download activities.  It also provides and enhanced experience for developers.  Adding your activity is a painless experience for activities which are hosted on GitHub.  If your activity is not on GitHub, you should <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/importing-an-external-git-repository">migrate it to GitHub</a> before adding it to the new ASLO.</p>

<h2>Submitting your activity</h2>

<p>All new activities must be checked by a human before they can be published.  In order to submit your activity you first must fork <a href="https://github.com/samdroid-apps/sugar-activities">sugar-activities</a>.  Then select the <code>data.json</code> file and click <code>edit</code>.  Fill out the following (interactive) template and paste it below line 2 (<code>&quot;activities&quot;: {</code>) in the file.</p>

<pre><code class="big">        "<span contenteditable>Your Activity's Bundle ID</span>": {
            "by": [
                {
                    "name": "<span contenteditable>Your Name</span>", 
                    "page": "<span contenteditable>Your Website or GitHub profile URL</span>",
                    "email": "<span contenteditable>Your Email Address</span>"
                }
            ]
        },
</code></pre>

<p>Then scroll down, enter a commit message (eg: Added My Awesome Activity) and press <code>commit</code>.  After that you will need to submit a pull request.  Click the little green pull request button (back on the repository main page) then click <code>Create pull request</code>.  Please include your activity&#39;s link in the pull request description.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted the pull request, your activity will be reviewed.  If your activity is approved, you can move on to building/uploading your activity.</p>

<h2>Building/Uploading your activity</h2>

<p>The new ASLO tightly integrates with GitHub, so building is as simple as adding a webhook.  To add the webhook, go to your activity&#39;s GitHub repository.  Then go into the settings (the icon on the right), into Webhooks &amp; Services (the menu item on the left) and click <code>Add webhook</code>.  Fill out the following (interactive) template and put it in the payload URL field.</p>

<p><pre><code>http://aslo-bot-master.sugarlabs.org/hook/<span contenteditable>GitHub User name</span>/<span contenteditable>GitHub Repository Name</span>/<span contenteditable>Activity Bundle ID</span></code></pre><br/></p>

<p>After filling out the payload URL, click <code>Add webhook</code>.  Your activity will be automatically placed on the new ASLO next time you <code>git push</code>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After you have gone through the process of adding your activity, you can <a href="http://aslo.cf">go and see it online</a>.  The activity is now avaiable for users around the world!
